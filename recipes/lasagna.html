    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over 
            medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. 
            Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, 
            Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for 
            about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna 
            noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and 
            rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 
            tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 
            9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. 
            Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the 
            mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, 
            and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
            Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray 
            or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. 
            Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
